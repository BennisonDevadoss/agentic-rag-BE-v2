# AgenticRAG

A production-ready agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application built with LangGraph. This app empowers an AI agent to intelligently use multiple tools—such as vector databases and APIs—to answer complex questions by dynamically retrieving and combining information from various sources. Easily extensible and robust, this application is designed for real-world deployment.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BennisonDevadoss/AgenticRAG.git
cd AgenticRAG
```

---

### 2. Set Up Conda Environment

If you don't have Conda installed, refer to the [Conda Installation Guide](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install).

Once Conda is installed:

```bash
# Create the environment
conda env create --name agentic-rag python=3.11

# Activate the environment
conda activate agentic-rag

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.staging
cp .env.example .env.production
cp .env.example .env.development
```

Edit the values in each `.env.{environment_name}` file as needed.

---

### 4. Set the Active Environment

Set the appropriate environment before running the application:

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=development  # or staging / production
```

---

### 5. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

---

### 6. Seed the Database

```bash
cd app/seeders/
python seed.py
cd ../..
```

---

### 7. Set Up `crawl4ai`

To configure and initialize the `crawl4ai` component used for document ingestion:

```bash
crawl4ai-setup
```

---

### 8. Run the Application

You can run the app in two ways:

**Option 1: Inline environment variable**

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development python main.py
```

**Option 2: Export and run**

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=development
python main.py
```

---

### 9. Run Celery Worker

To run background tasks (e.g., ingestion, summarization, etc.), start the Celery worker: Make sure you are in `app` dir.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. celery -A queues.worker worker --loglevel=info -Q <queue_name>
```

> Replace `<queue_name>` with the desired queue (e.g., `default`, `ingestion`, etc.)

## Environment Usage Guidelines

- **Development** (`ENVIRONMENT=development`):
  For local development and testing. Includes debug logs and test configs.

- **Staging** (`ENVIRONMENT=staging`):
  For pre-production testing. Mimics the production setup with test data.

- **Production** (`ENVIRONMENT=production`):
  For live deployment. Connects to production-grade services and uses secure configs.
